# Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## Problem Description
Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **ascending order** (with distinct values), the array may have been **left rotated** at an unknown index `k` (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array looks like:  


You are required to find the **index of a target value** in the array. If the target does not exist in the array, return `-1`.

You **must** implement an algorithm with **O(log n)** runtime complexity.

## Examples

### Example 1
```text
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
